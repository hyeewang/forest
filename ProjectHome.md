Forest is a tool for rapid development of system images. In addition to building images, it can be used as a type of distributed installation and configuration tool (such as kickstart or puppet).

You don't have to install forest to use it.

**Refer to [Network Deployments](http://treebuilder.googlecode.com/hg-history/0.6/docs/build/html/topics/usage/network-deployment.html) for the recommended way of using forest.**

If building a forest from scratch run "make" in the root directory to create the bin/tree-build binary.
